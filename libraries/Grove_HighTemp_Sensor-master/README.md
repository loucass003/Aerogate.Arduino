[Grove - High Temperature Sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-High-Temperature-Sensor-p-1810.html)

Thermocouples are very sensitive, requiring a good amplifier with a cold - compensation reference. The Grove - Temperature Sensor USES a K type thermocouple Temperature detection, with a Thermistor to detect The ambient Temperature as Temperature compensation. The detectable range of this Sensor is -50-600℃ , and The accuracy is ±(2.0% + 2℃)
